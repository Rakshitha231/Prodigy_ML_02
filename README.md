# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project aims to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The segmentation is done using customer attributes such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

# 📊 Objective:
To implement a machine learning model that identifies distinct customer segments, helping the business tailor marketing strategies to specific groups.

# 📁 Dataset:
Kaggle Dataset: Customer Segmentation

# 🛠️ Tech Stack:

>Python,Pandas, NumPy

>Scikit-learn 

>Streamlit 

>Pickle 

# 🔄 Workflow:

>Data Preprocessing: Selected relevant features and applied standard scaling.

>Model Training: Used K-Means clustering with 5 clusters.

>Model Deployment: Created a Streamlit web app for live predictions.

>Cluster Insights: Displayed customer group interpretations based on income and spending habits.

# 🎯 Output Segments:

>Cluster 0: Average income and spending

>Cluster 1: High income, high spending — Premium Customers

>Cluster 2: Low income, low spending — Budget Customers

>Cluster 3: High income, low spending — Cautious Customers

>Cluster 4: Low income, high spending — Impulsive Customers
